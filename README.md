ecco_stuff_v17 is the NEWEST version of the code which contains both the correct momentum equations and also inputs using lat/lon instead of xy
tracer equations in ecco_stuff_v17 still have to be finalized, but the diffusivity coefficients have been initialized such that Kx, Ky = 1e3 and Kz = 1e-5
no validation set has yet been incorporated into the model, 3d plot of the cube ocean still has to be modified to be a colormap instead of contour plot
